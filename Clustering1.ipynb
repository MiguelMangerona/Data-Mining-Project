    "Step 1: Understand the Data\n",
    "Start by defining the variables and dimensions that are critical for segmentation (e.g., demographic features, behavior, frequency).\n",
    "Ensure you preprocess your data (cleaning, normalization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Select a Clustering Technique\n",
    "Use Hierarchical Methods if:\n",
    "You need to visualize the relationships among clusters.\n",
    "You are unsure about the number of clusters beforehand.\n",
    "Use Partition Methods (e.g., K-Means) if:\n",
    "You have a predefined notion of the number of clusters.\n",
    "You aim for simplicity and interpretability.\n",
    "Use DBSCAN if:\n",
    "Your data has noise or irregular shapes.\n",
    "Use Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for advanced analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Evaluate the Results\n",
    "Use metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, or visual inspection (PCA or t-SNE) to evaluate the quality of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Explain the Clusters\n",
    "Describe the characteristics of each cluster.\n",
    "Link the clusters to actionable business insights.\n",

    "Step 5: Consider RFM Analysis\n",
    "If your dataset involves customer transactions, perform RFM analysis for segmentation:\n",
    "Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.\n",
    "Frequency: How often they purchase.\n",
    "Monetary: How much they spend."
